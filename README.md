#Super Library

Super Libaray is a javascript library I have created. It started off as a way to practice coding using OOP, however it quickly became a project that I'll continue to update overtime.

###SuperElement

This method allows the creation of elements such as a div or button.

```javascript
 const btn = ('element', {type: 'button', name: 'exampleBtn', options: [['value', 'Example']] })

 btn.appendTo(document.body)
```
